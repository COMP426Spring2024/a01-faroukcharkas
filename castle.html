          <ul>
            <li>
              In the heart of a world shrouded in the mists of time, the Order
              of Gimghoul holds court within the enigmatic walls of Hippol
              Castle, a realm more commonly whispered among the initiated as
              Gimghoul Castle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Edward Wray Martin, a visionary law student and founding soul of
              the Order, ignited by the fires of his passion for Arthurian
              legends, dreamt a dream bold and grand. His voice, fervent and
              unwavering, conjured from the echoes of medieval ballads,
              envisioned a fortress not of this age: a sanctuary for knights of
              shadow and light, amidst a world blind to the magic that dwells in
              the unseen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Martin's dream was a citadel perched on the brink of eternity, a
              "great gloomy pile" standing as a guardian over the abyss, a stage
              upon which the secret dances of the Order could unfold, shrouded
              from the gaze of mortals.
            </li>
            <li>
              The origins of this castle, veiled in the whispers of the past,
              are a tale of mystery and marvel. Crafted in 1926 by the hands of
              Waldensian stone-masons from Valdese, North Carolina, or perhaps
              by French artisans, the castle rose, stone by stone, a testament
              to the arcane, enveloped in tales of its creation that span from
              1924 to the ambiguous depths of the 1920s.
            </li>
            <li>
              This fortress, a labor of love and secrecy, demanded a king's
              ransom to emerge from the earth, its construction devouring over
              $50,000—a sum that whispers of fortunes in today's silver and
              gold.
            </li>
            <li>
              To breathe life into their monumental dream, the Order parted with
              35 acres of land, sowing the seeds of the Gimghoul Neighborhood
              Historic District, a legacy carved from the very essence of their
              ambition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set beyond the confines of mere academia, at the terminus of
              Gimghoul Road and in the shadow of the Old Chapel Hill Cemetery,
              this castle stands as a monument to the unseen, its dominion
              marked by a valuation soaring beyond the realm of a million
              dreams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legend holds that beneath its foundations, or perhaps within a
              stone's throw, lies the heart of the saga—Peter Dromgoole's final
              rest, his spirit wandering the castle grounds, a sentinel bound to
              the realm of the living by the crimson stain of his blood on
              Dromgoole Rock, an eternal testament to a tale of love, loss, and
              the undying echo of legend.
