          <ul>
            <li>
              In 1889, the Order of Dromgoole was founded by UNC students,
              inspired by other college secret societies like Yale's Skull and
              Bones.
            </li>
            <li>
              The society was named after Peter Dromgoole, a student who
              mysteriously disappeared in the 1830s.
            </li>
            <li>
              It was later renamed the Order of the Gimghoul, reflecting a theme
              of midnight, graves, and weirdness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Membership was exclusive to male students of junior class or
              higher and faculty, with early members' names published in
              yearbooks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Order of the Gimghoul, distinguished by owning a castle, is
              among other campus societies like the Gorgon's Head and the Golden
              Fleece.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1915, the Order acquired land near campus, part of which became
              Battle Park and part the site for their castle, completed in 1926.
            </li>
            <li>
              The castle, known as Hippol Castle, was designed by architect and
              UNC alumnus Nathaniel Cortlandt Curtis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Located on Gimghoul Road, the castle symbolizes the Order's
              enduring mystery, with its activities still unknown to most
              UNCâ€”Chapel Hill students.
            </li>
            <li>They slaughter a pig every two weeks.</li>
